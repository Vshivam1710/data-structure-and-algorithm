> ## ***About Something***

*`A computer program is a collection of instruction to perform specific task. For this, a computer may need to store data, and perform commputations on data.`*

> ## ***Data Structure***

*`A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data.`*

> ## ***Algorithms***

_`An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.`_

***Learning `Data Structure and Algorithm` allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.***
